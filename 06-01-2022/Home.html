    <h3>What is paragraph ?</h3>
    <p>
        A paragraph is a series of related sentences developing a central idea, called the <strong>topic</strong> . Try to think
        about paragraphs in terms of thematic unity: a paragraph is a sentence or a group of sentences that supports one
        central, unified idea. Paragraphs add one idea at a time to your broader argument.
    </p>

    <h3>
        How do I <em>unify</em> my ideas in a paragraph?
    </h3>

    <p>Probably the most effective way to achieve paragraph unity is to express the central idea of the paragraph in a
        topic sentence. <br>
        Topic sentences are similar to <strong> mini thesis statements</strong>. Like a thesis statement, a topic
        sentence has a specific main point. Whereas the thesis is the main point of the essay, the topic sentence is the
        main point of the paragraph. Like the thesis statement, a topic sentence has a unifying function. But a thesis
        statement or topic sentence alone doesn’t guarantee unity. An essay is unified if all the paragraphs relate to
        the thesis, whereas a paragraph is unified if all the sentences relate to the topic sentence. Note: Not all
        paragraphs need topic sentences. In particular, opening and closing paragraphs, which serve different functions
        from body paragraphs, generally don’t have topic sentences.

        journalists has been one of its most notable features in recent years: for both groups the use of Twitter is
        becoming close to a requirement.</blockquote>

            An essay is unified if all the paragraphs relate to the thesis, whereas a paragraph is unified if all the
            sentences relate to the topic sentence.
